/*
takes a file as an input (./HoopsStats statsfile.txt). The file
contains a list of basketball players and some stats about them.
outputs a number of lines equal to the number of players, and 
each line is the playerâ€™s name, jersey number, and year of graduation. 
lines are sorted in descending order of average points per game. 
In the case of equal points/game, sort by last name.
